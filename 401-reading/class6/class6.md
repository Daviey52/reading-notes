# How to use Random Module

Random module provides access to functions that support generation of random numbers. If we want a random integer, we can use the randint function that accepts two parameters: A lowest and a highest number. Random. choice () allow generation of a random value from a sequence. Shuffle function shuffles the elements in list in place so that they are in a random order.

## What is risk analysis

The probability of any unwanted incident is referred to as risk. Software testing risk analysis os the process of identifying the risk in application and prioritizing them to test. After the process of assigning the level of risk, categorization of the risks takes place
Some of the main risk include: Business risk, testing risks , premature release risk, software risks
Performing risk analysis includes searching the risk, analyzing the impact of each individual risk and measure for the risk identified.

## Test Coverage

Test coverage is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase. It is used as a numerical statement of how good your test are.
You are doing good testing if you rarely get bugs that escape into production and you rarely hesitant to change some code due to fear that it will cause production bugs.
