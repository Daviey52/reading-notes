1. Deliberate practice is necessary to improve hard technical skills. Doing the same thing over and over does not necessarily mean improvement in hard technical skills. More learning happens during the beginning of careers since, we are forced to learn new concepts consistently. The main pros for deliberate practice is pushing ourselves beyond our comfort zones, force use to repeat often, feedback is always available, it’s difficult and it’s demanding mentally.
2. The goal of challenges should be that achieving them teaches us something new, without being too focused on the end result.
3. Not yet indicates a growth or a direction towards a growth with the possibility of success. Growth mindset allows as to easily face new challenges and learn the most from them.
4. Grit allows for success regardless of the normal characteristic necessary for success. Growth mindset is a great idea for building grit.
5. The fear of failing is mainly influenced by the judgement that follows. You can’t be successful at everything. Our ideas of success should be ours
