# Linked list

A linked list is a follow up of nodes that are connected to each other. The most common feature of them is that each node reference to the next node in the link.

Linked list have linear data structure.
Singly means a link list that only has one reference and the reference points to the next node in a linked list

Doubly there are two reference within a node. This means there is a reference to both the next and the previous node

Node are individual elements that live in a linked list

Next is an element contained by each node that reference the next node

Head is a reference to the first node in a linked list

Current is a reference to the node that is being looked at.

Best way to approach a traversal is by the use of a while loop
Big 0 for time in includes would be linear while for space would be constant.

Add() has a constant for space and time.
AddBefore() has a linear time big o and a constant space big o

## Big 0 notation

Itâ€™s a way of evaluating the performance of an algorithm

Big 0 evaluates running time and space

For factors used to analysis  big 0 include : input size , unit of measurement , order of growth and best case , worst case and average case.
