## Web Scrapping

Web scrapping is a technique of automatically saving large amounts of data from a website. It involves fetching and extracting relevant information. Fetching is downloading the page.

Web crawlers can retrieve data much quicker, in depth than humans, meaning bad scrapping practices can have some impact on the performance of a website. Some websites have features that block web scrapping.

Some of the basic web scrapping practices include
• Respect robots.txt
• Not following the same crawling pattern
• Avoid scrapping data behind a logging
• Make crawling slower, be nice
• Rotate user agent and corresponding HTTP requests Header between request
• Be aware of Honey pot traps
• Use Captcha solving services.

We can parse html with beautiful soup, by finding all relevant tags and selecting them.

We need to include a line of code that allows us to pause our software for a second without a website flagging us as a spammer.
