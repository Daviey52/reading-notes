## Structure , Extra Markup , HTML5 Layout , Process and Design & The ABC of Programming

### The ABC of programming

* Computers creates models of the world using data

* The models uses objects to represent physical things.

* Objects can have properties that tell us about the object: methods that perform the task using the properties of that object

* Programmers can write codes to say ' when this event occurs, run the code

* web browsers use HTML markup to create a model of the web pages. Each element creates its own node

* To make web pages interactive, you write code that uses the browser's model of the web page.

* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file.

* HTML script element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the javaScript file

* If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, becauses the script works with the model of the web page that the browser created.

### Structure

* HTML pages are basically text documents.

* HTML uses tags to give the information they surround special meaning

* Tags are often refered to as elements. they ussualy come in pairs. Opening tags denotes the start of a piece of content. The closing tags denotes the end.

* Opening tags can carry attributes that tell us more about the content of that element. Attributes require a name and a value

### Extra Markup

* DOCTYPES tells browser which version of HTML you are using

* ID and Class attributes allow you to identify particular elements

* The div and span elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together

* iframe cut windows into your web pages though which other pages can be diplayed

* The meta tag allows you to supply all kind of information about your web page

* Escape characters are used to include special characters in you pages such as < ,>

### HTML5 Layout

* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

* The new elements provide clearer code compared to the use of multiple div elements

* Older browser that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be informed which elements are block-level elements

* To make HTML5 element work in Internet Explorer 8 , extra JavaScrip is needed, which is available free from Google.

### Process & Design

* It is important to understand your target audience.  Why would they come to your site , what information they want to find and when they are likely to return

* site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site

* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page

* Design is about communication. visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them

* You can differentiate between piece of information using size , color and style

* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
