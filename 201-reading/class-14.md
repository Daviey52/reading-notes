CSS transforms, Transitions and Animations

* Transform property comes in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional transforms. Each comes with its own indivivudal properties and values

* 2d transformation works on the x and y axes, know as the vertical and horizontal axes. 3d on the other hand works on both the x and y axes as well as the z axis.

* some of the 2d transforms include 2d rotate, 2d scale, 2d Translate 2d skew.

* it is possible to combine multiple transforms on one element

* In order for a three dimensional transform to work, the elements need a perspective from which to transform. The perspective can be thought of as a vanishing point.

* 3D Transforms include 3D rotate , 3d scale ,3d translate ,3d skew ,

* for transition to take place, an element must have a change in state and different style must be identified for each state. The easiest way for identifying styles for different states is by using the :hover:active:focus and target pseudo-classes.

* Using transition values alone, it is possible to set every transition value in the order of transition-property, transition duration , transition-timing-function and transition delay. Don not use commas with these values.

* Animation also provide the ability to further customize an elemen'ts behavior, including the ability to declare the nunber of times and animation runs, as well as the direction in which it completes.

1. fade in

3. Grow and shrink
