## HTML Lists , Control Flow with JS , and the CSS Box Model

### List

* HTML provides us with three different types of list: Ordered List , Unordered List , Definition List.

* Ordered list is created with the ol element while unordered list is created with ul element.

* The defination list is created with the dl element and ussualy consist of a series of terms and their definations.

### Boxes

* By default, a box is sized just big enough to hold its content. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width property.

* The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentage or ems.

* Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its apperance: They are Border , Margin and Padding

* Padding and margin properties are very helpful when adding space between various items on a page

* If you want to center a box on a page, you can set the left and right margin to auto.

* Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the heading

* CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

### Control with JS

* an array is a special type of variable. it does not just store a vaalue but it also stores a list of values

* Values in array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to understand that the numbering of the list starts at zero

* The if ... else statement checks a condition. if it resolves to true, the first code block is executed. if the condition resolves to false, the second code block is run instead.

* A switch statemtn starts with a variable called switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

* If you use a data type that JavaScript did not expect, it tries to make sence of the operation rather than report an error

* A unary operator returns a result with just one operand

* Loops check a conditon. if it is true, a code block will run. then the conditon will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false.

* The common types of loops are: FOR , WHILEand DO While.

* Three points to consider when working with loops are : Keyword , Break , Continue.
