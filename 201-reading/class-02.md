## Basics of HTML , CSS & JS

### Text

* When creating a web page, you add tags known as markup to the content of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browser to show users the appropriate structure of the page

* Structure markup are the elements that you can use to describe both heading and paragraphs

* Semantic markups are those that provide extra information, including where emphasis is placed in a sentance, that something you have written is a quotation.

* HTML has six levels of heading

* Sup element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power.

* Sub element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. Commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as H20.

* Content management systems and HTML editors ussualy have two view of the page being created. this includes a visual editor ad a code view.

* Semantic markup are text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of a web page but to add extra information to the pages.

### CSS

* CSS alow users to make rules that specify ho the content of an element should appear. for instance specify the background color.

* The key to understand how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML. CSS allows users to create rules that control the way that each individual box is presented.

* CSS decralation sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts. a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

* CSS selectors are case sensitive so they must match element name and attribute values exactly.

* When building a website, there are several advantage to placing your CSS ru;es in a separate style sheet.

### Basic JavaScripts

* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instructions or step is known as a statement. Statements should end in a semicolon.

* A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. it can store this data in a variable.

* Before you can use a variable, you need to announce that you want to use it. This involves creating the variable and giving it a name. Programmers say they declare the variable. Once the variable has been created, you can tell it what information you would like it to store for you

* Once you have assigned a value to a variable, you can then change what is stored in the variable later in the script

* an array is a special type of variable. it does not just store a vaalue but it also stores a list of values

* Values in array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to understand that the numbering of the list starts at zero

* The if ... else statement checks a condition. if it resolves to true, the first code block is executed. if the condition resolves to false, the second code block is run instead.

* A switch statemtn starts with a variable called switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

* If you use a data type that JavaScript did not expect, it tries to make sence of the operation rather than report an error

* A unary operator returns a result with just one operand

* Loops check a conditon. if it is true, a code block will run. then the conditon will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false.

* The common types of loops are: FOR , WHILEand DO While.

* Three points to consider when working with loops are : Keyword , Break , Continue.
