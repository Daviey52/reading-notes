## HTML Links , JS Functions, and Intor to CSS Layout

### Links

* Links are defining features of the web because they allow you to move from one page to another, enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing

* Links are created using the a element.

* On a larger website, it is a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages from each different section of the site into a new folder

### Layout

* CSS treats each HTML element as it is its own box. this box will either be a block-level box or an inline box

* If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element, the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

* CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow , absolute positioning and relative positioning.

* To indicate where a box should be positioned, it might be necessarly to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left and right it should be placed.

* when you move any element from normal flox, boxes can overlap. this is reffered to as the z-index prperty. it allows you to control which box appears on top.

* Floating element allows the user ti take an element out of normal flow ad position it to the far left or right of a containing box. The clear property allows the user to say that no element should touch the left or right sides of a box

* when moving an element from normal flow, boxes can overlap hence the need to use the Z-index property to control which box appears on top.

* Many web pages use multiple columns in their designs. This can be achieved using a div element to represent each column

* different visitors to a website will have iffernet sized screens that show different amounts of informations. Meaning their is a need to be able to work a range of different sized screens.

* Since screen sizes and display resolution vary so much, web designer try to create web pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide.

* compostion of any visual art is the placement or arrangement of visual elements - how they are organised in a page. Many designeres use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, the same is true for web designeres.

* CSS framework are designed to help in providing the code for common task such as layout grid , styling forms , creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on.

* Some webpage authors split up their CSS style rules into separate style sheet. There are two ways to add multiple style sheets to a page

1. Your HTML page can link o one style sheet and stylesheet can use the @import rule to import other style sheets
2. in the HTML page you can use a speparate link element for each style sheet.

### Functions, Methods and Objects

### Functions, Methods Objects

* Functions consists of a group of objects that have been grouped together becuse they perform a specific task.

* Method is the same as functions except they are created inside( and are part of an object)

* piece of information passed to a function are know as parameters

* When you write a function and expect it to provide you with an answer, the responce is known as return value.

* Functional declaration is giving a function a name and then writing statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.

* In some cases a function need specific information to perform its task, in such cases, when you declare the function, you give it parameters inside the function, the parameter act like variables.

* when you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name. The values are called arguments and they can be provided as values or variable.

* If a function is placed where a browser expects to see an expression, it gets treated as an expresion, and this is know as a function expression.

* In a function expression, the name is normally ommited

* A functional expression is not processed until the interpreter gets to that statement. This means it can not be called before the interpreter has discovered it.

* Anonymous functions are used for code that only needs to run once within a task , rather than repeately being called by other parts of the script

* The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within a code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used within that function. This is know as the variable's scope.

* Global variable use more memory. The browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Local variables are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed.

* Literal notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects.

* You can access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation. You can also access properties using a square bracket.

* The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects, where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers to the one object, ussualy the object in which the function operates.

* In javaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs. To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as key.

* Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the browser window and the current web page shpwn in that window. These buil-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages.

* Browser Object model creates a model of the browser tab or window

* Bocument Object Model creates model of the current web page

* Global JavaScript Objects do not form a single model. They are a group of individual object that relate to different parts of the JavaScript language.

### Reasons for pair programming

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. social skills
5. job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
