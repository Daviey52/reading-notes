1. Be relevant
2. Convey information
3. Convey the right mood

* Where an image is placed in the code will affect ho it is displayed.

* There are three rules to remember when creating images for your website. These are: save images in the right format , save images at the right size , measure images in pixel.

* Images used on a website should be saved at the same width and height that you want them to appear on a page

* Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe illustrator.

### Color

* The color property allows user to specif the color of text inside an element.

* Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

* By default most browsers have a white background, but browser users can set a background color for their window.

* Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red , green and blue.

* When picking foreground and background colors. it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.

* CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specifiy colors using saturation , hue and lightness value.

### Text

* The property that allows you to control the apperance of text can be split into two groups:

1. Those that directly affect the font and its apperance including the typeface, whether it is regular , bold or italic and the size of the text
2. Those that would have the same effects on text no matter what font you were using including color of text and spacing between words and letter

* When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will ussualy only display itif it's installed on that user's computer.

* Photoshop and InDesign offer the same size of text becuse they are set according to a scale or ratio that was developed by European typographer in the sixteenth century.

* setting font size in pixels is the best way to ensure that the type appears at the size intended.

* You can specify different values for the first letter or first line of text inside an element using: first-letter , first-line. These are know as pseudo-elements.
